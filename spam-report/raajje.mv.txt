Subject: Spam Abuse Report - raajje.mv

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to report a spam message that I received from the raajje.mv domain. I have attached a screenshot of the spam message to this email for your reference.

The email appears to be unsolicited and contains content that is irrelevant to me. I believe that this email violates the terms and conditions of the .mv domain, as well as international anti-spam laws.

I kindly request that you take immediate action to investigate this matter and ensure that the raajje.mv domain is not used for spamming or other abusive activities in the future.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Dejavu Moe

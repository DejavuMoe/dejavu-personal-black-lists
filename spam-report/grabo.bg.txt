Subject: Abuse Complaint - Phishing and Scam Messages from grabo.bg Domain

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to file an abuse complaint against the grabo.bg domain, which I believe is being used to send phishing emails and scam messages to unsuspecting recipients. I have received several such messages myself, and I am concerned that others may also be targeted by this activity.

As you may be aware, phishing is a serious crime that involves the use of fraudulent emails, websites, and other means to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Similarly, scam messages can lead to financial losses and other forms of harm to individuals and businesses.

I would like to request that you investigate this matter and take appropriate action to address the misuse of the grabo.bg domain. I believe that this activity is in violation of the .bg domain registry's policies and guidelines, and that steps should be taken to prevent further harm to innocent individuals and organizations.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
Dejavu Moe
